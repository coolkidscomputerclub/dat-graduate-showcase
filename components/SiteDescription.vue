    Digital Art &amp; Technology is a tough course to sum-up — it unveils a new
    cohort of fresh-faced creative folk every year; each of whom is equipped
    with a different — often unique — set of skills. We're interaction
    designers, game developers, creative technologists, and yet so much more.
    Take a look around; we hope you'll be impressed and are sure you'll be
    surprised.
