  Digital Art & Technology is a tough course to sum-up —
  it unveils a new cohort of fresh-faced creative folk every year;
  each of whom is equipped with a different — often unique — set of skills.
  We're interaction designers, game developers, creative technologists, and yet so much more.
  Take a look around; we hope you'll be impressed and are sure you'll be surprised.
