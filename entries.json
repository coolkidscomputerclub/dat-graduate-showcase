Benefiting from everything that transition brings with it: affordance, ambience, and embodiment.</p><p>Incoming messages are instantiated as wooden marbles which can be used to playback their corresponding audio files. </p><p>Based on user input and google latitude data; Message Box diverts incoming calls, prompting the caller to leave a message if the recipient is busy, or connecting the call if the user is either available or not in the vicinity of the box.</p>",
